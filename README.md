Project Title:      Real-Time Face Detection And Tracking

Author:             Sachin Vishwanath

Abstract:

Face detection and tracking has been an important and active research field because it
offers many applications, especially in video surveillance, biometrics, or video coding. The face detection algorithm involved color-based skin segmentation and image filtering. The face location was determined by calculating the centroid of the
detected region. A software version of the algorithm was independently implemented and
tested on still pictures in MATLAB. All calculation of the hardware implementation was done in real time with minimal
computational effort, thus suitable for power-limited applications.
